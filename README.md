# fyp_uav
Code developed for final year university project. Aim of the project was to develop an autonomous UAV to operate close to target structures in GPS denied environments. As it stands, this repository only contains the ROS code that was used and does not include all data and documentation from the project.

This code was developed by Logan Porter and Theo Drissner-Devine under the supervision of DR. Karl Stol. However, code from various sources was used and editted heavily in developing this software.
